# REACT-REDUX-NODE APP

This is a basic react redux app with node and express backend. This app shows what surveys are asigned to each employee and what surveys can be assigned.

## Run the App

### `npm run dev`

You can start the app from the root folder by entering command ***npm run dev***
.<br/> Both node app and react app will run concurrently so you don't have to open two<br/> terminals to run both backend and frontend.<br/>
